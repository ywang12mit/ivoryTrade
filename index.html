        <h5 class="personnel">By Lucia Liu, Hannah Lienhard, and Chloe Wang.</h5>
        </br>
        <p> There were 26 million elephants roaming the African continent before the 1850s, when ivory trade started. Today, there are only 600,000 African elephants left (2% of its orginal population). And each year about 26,000 elephants are poached annually for their ivory. At this rate, this magnificent species will be extinct in 23 years.</p>
        <!-- <p>Ivory is carved to produe piano keys, jewelry, chess sets ... But all of these products are replacable with many other materials, such as wood and degradable plastic. Explore the graph below to see how easy ivory is replaced and thus the killing of elephants is not necessary and has to be stopped to save this iconic animal.</p> -->

        <!-- <p> Elephant Ivory is used for a wide variety of objects. Each of these objects uses up quite a bit of ivory for production, and thus requires killing a certain number of elephants. This graphic is designed to help you learn about the impact of using and purchasing ivory products. Click on object names to learn how much ivory is required to make it, how many elephants are killed in the process, and how much wood you could use instead.</p> -->

        <p>Since 2003, a statistic called <span id="PIKE">Proportion of Illegally Killed Elephants</span> or <span id="PIKE">PIKE</span>, has been constantly monitored. Organizations estimate the annual PIKE statistic in Africa by locating elephant carcasses in sites all around the country. A carcass can either be from an elephant that died naturally or an elephant that died from illegal human action. The data below were obtained from the organization, Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).</p>

        <p>Elephants have roamed the wild for 15 million years, but today this iconic species face the biggest threat to survival due to continued ivory poaching. As long as there is a demand for ivory, elephants continue to be killed for their tusks. Today it is estimated up to 26,000 elephants are killed annually.</p>

        <p id="quote"><i>"Our hearts bleed in the knowledge that if we continue living as we are, elephants will no longer exist in the wild ten short years from today. These magnificent creatures experience the same emotional complexity as humans and their young suffer overwhelming and prolonged grief after witnessing a parent killed for ivory. The Ian Somerhalder Foundation attests that all life on this planet is interwoven and interconnected, therefore their suffering and grief is ultimately OUR suffering and grief. The IS Foundation stands alongside The David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust in support of their iworry campaign to stop the senseless killing of these majestic animals."</i></br>- Ian Somerhalder</p>
